# odin-recipe
This is the first project made by me in my web design journey.

The website contains food recipes made by me and my girlfriend in the last couple of months.

With this project I am looking to consolidate my basic HTML skills, including formatting the website, creating basic texts, lists, images and links.

Enjoy!
